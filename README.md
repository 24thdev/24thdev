## Hi there 👋
I'm learning to code/IT since the start of 2025 and just started a Python course. And like many others, I find the possibilities of AI truly amazing.
Right now, I’d like to build a platform to learn finance by law in a new, never-before-seen and deeply intuitive way — so that users can become their own advisors. And yes, the goal is to monetize it, reasonably.

By training a language model, probably using BERT, to understand all the legal rules of “the money game,” it should become capable of explaining these rules and guiding users further if desired.

Short backstory:
My first exposure to programming (next to computers, of course) was through Bitcoin. I became interested and invested. Along the way, I also invested in other financial products and needed more information about complex financial instruments and structures. While there are many free content creators with useful explanations, it’s never truly tailored to your personal needs — and you can’t easily dive deeper, let alone fully trust the source.
Out of frustration, and with the rise of AI, I thought: Can’t I just train a model to understand all this and then have it explain it to me — and to anyone else who wants to know more?

Turns out, it’s not that simple.
But now I’m trying, and succeeding, in finding my why through the fascinating world of programming… or coding… or developing — I’m not even sure what to call it yet.

If you're interested in this project and would like to collaborate or help in any way, shape, or form — it’s much appreciated. You can reach me @ my GitHub: /24thdev
